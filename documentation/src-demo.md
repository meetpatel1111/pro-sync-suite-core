# Demo Utilities Documentation (`src/demo`)

This document describes the demo utilities found in the `src/demo` folder. These files are typically used for development, testing, or demonstration purposes and are not part of the core application logic.

---

## Folder Purpose
- Contains scripts and utilities for demonstrating or testing app features.
- Helps developers simulate notifications, events, or other behaviors during development.
- Not included in production builds or user-facing features.

---

## File Summary

### demoNotify.ts
- Provides functions to simulate or trigger notification events in the app.
- Useful for testing notification UIs, toasts, and feedback flows during development.
- Can be used to verify notification styling, timing, and integration with the notification context/provider.

---

## Best Practices
- Use demo utilities only in development or staging environments.
- Remove or disable demo/test code before deploying to production.
- Keep demo files isolated from production logic for maintainability.

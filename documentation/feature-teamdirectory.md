# Feature Deep Dive: Team Directory

## Functional Overview
The Team Directory provides a searchable, filterable list of all users, team members, and collaborators in the organization. It supports user profiles, roles, and quick actions (message, assign, etc.).

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Components:** Directory UI, profile cards, search/filter controls.
- **Service:** Integrates with user data from the database and context providers.
- **State Management:** Uses React state/hooks for filtering and selection.
- **Integration:** Ties into messaging, assignment, and resource management features.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Keep directory logic modular for reuse in other features.
- Provide fast, responsive search and filtering.
- Display role and status information clearly.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure user data is up to date and synced from the backend.
- Check for missing profile or role information.

## Extensibility
- Add org charts, reporting lines, or advanced filters.
- Integrate with external HR or directory systems.

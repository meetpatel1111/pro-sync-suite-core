# Feature Deep Dive: ResourceHub

## Functional Overview
ResourceHub allows users to manage resources, skills, allocations, and availability. It supports project planning, skills matrix visualization, and resource utilization reporting.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Pages & Components:** `src/pages/ResourceHub.tsx` is the main entry, with tabs for different resource features.
- **Service:** `src/services/resourcehub.ts`, `resourceAllocations.ts`, and related modules handle all resource CRUD and reporting logic.
- **State Management:** Uses React state and context for managing resource data and UI state.
- **Integration:** Connects with user, project, and task data for holistic resource management.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Use tabbed UI for feature-rich resource management.
- Delegate business logic to services; keep UI components focused on display and interaction.
- Provide visual feedback for data loading, errors, and updates.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all resource data is loaded before rendering reports or matrices.
- Check for missing or malformed data in the backend.

## Extensibility
- Add custom reporting, export, or analytics modules.
- Integrate with external HR or project management systems.

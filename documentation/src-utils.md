# Utilities Documentation (`src/utils`)

This document provides a deep-dive into the utility modules found in the `src/utils` folder. Utility files contain helper functions, type definitions, and sample data that support core features and services across the Pro Sync Suite Core application.

---

## Folder Purpose
- Provides reusable helpers for database operations, type definitions, and mock/sample data.
- Supports core services, context providers, and feature modules with common logic and structures.
- Promotes maintainability, DRY principles, and type safety.

---

## File Summaries

### db-helpers.ts
- Contains helper functions for interacting with the database layer.
- May include query builders, data transformation, or utility functions used by services and contexts.
- Keeps database logic modular and reusable.

### dbtypes.d.ts, dbtypes.ts
- TypeScript type definitions for database entities (users, tasks, projects, settings, etc.).
- Ensures type safety and consistency across services, contexts, and components.
- `dbtypes.d.ts` provides type declarations, while `dbtypes.ts` may include runtime helpers or type-related logic.

### sampleData.ts
- Provides mock or sample data for development, testing, or demonstration.
- Useful for populating the UI or services with example data during development.
- Should not be used in production environments.

---

## Best Practices
- Keep utility logic generic and reusable.
- Use type definitions to enforce consistency and prevent runtime errors.
- Isolate sample/mock data from production logic.

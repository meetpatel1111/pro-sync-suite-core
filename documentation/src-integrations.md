# Integrations Documentation (`src/integrations`)

This document provides a deep-dive into the integrations layer found in the `src/integrations` folder. Integrations connect the Pro Sync Suite Core application to external services and APIs, enabling authentication, data storage, and automation.

---

## Folder Purpose
- Contains all integration logic and configuration for connecting with third-party services.
- Encapsulates client initialization, type definitions, and service-specific utilities.
- Promotes modularity and separation of concerns for external dependencies.

---

## Subfolder: supabase/

### client.ts
- Initializes and exports the Supabase client for use throughout the app.
- Handles connection to the Supabase backend using environment variables for URL and API key.
- Provides a single source of truth for all Supabase operations (auth, database, storage, etc.).

### types.ts
- Defines type aliases or interfaces specific to Supabase integration.
- Ensures type safety and consistency when interacting with Supabase APIs.

---

## Integration Points
- The Supabase client is imported by services, hooks, and context providers for authentication and data operations.
- Types are used to ensure safe and predictable integration code.

---

## Best Practices
- Keep integration clients and types isolated from core business logic.
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive credentials.
- Extend the integrations folder as new services (e.g., Slack, Google, etc.) are added.

# Feature Deep Dive: Type Definitions

## Functional Overview
Type definitions provide structure, safety, and clarity for all entities, APIs, and data flows in the codebase. They are essential for maintainability and reliability in a TypeScript project.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Files:** `src/types/`, `src/utils/dbtypes.ts`, `dbtypes.d.ts`, etc. contain all custom and third-party type definitions.
- **Integration:** Types are used throughout services, contexts, components, and API helpers.
- **Type Safety:** Ensures all data structures are strongly typed, reducing runtime errors.
- **Module Augmentation:** Extends third-party types (e.g., Express) for custom logic.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Keep type definitions up to date as the data model evolves.
- Use module augmentation for third-party integrations.
- Document types for clarity and onboarding.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all entities and APIs are typed.
- Check for missing or outdated type definitions.

## Extensibility
- Add new types/interfaces as features and integrations grow.
- Refactor for DRYness and maintainability.

# Feature Deep Dive: TaskMaster

## Functional Overview
TaskMaster provides advanced task management for projects and teams. Users can create, assign, update, and track tasks, supporting workflow automation and productivity.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Pages & Components:** `src/pages/TaskMaster.tsx` provides the UI for managing tasks, assignments, and statuses.
- **Service:** `src/services/taskMasterService.ts` and `taskmaster.ts` encapsulate all task-related business logic and data access.
- **State Management:** Uses React state/hooks for UI, with context or service for persistent data.
- **Integration:** Connects with user, project, and notification systems for end-to-end task flow.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Separate task logic from UI; keep business rules in services.
- Provide feedback for task actions (create, update, complete).
- Support bulk actions and filtering for productivity.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure task data is loaded before rendering UI.
- Check for assignment/user mismatches in the backend.

## Extensibility
- Add custom task types, automation, or integrations with external tools.
- Extend notification and reporting for advanced workflows.

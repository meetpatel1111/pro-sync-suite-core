# Feature Deep Dive: API Layer

## Functional Overview
The API layer provides helper functions for interacting with backend services, facilitating data fetching, mutation, and integration with external APIs.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Files:** `src/api/` contains modules for each API domain (filevault, integrationDashboard, etc.).
- **Integration:** API helpers are used by services, context providers, and components for all backend communication.
- **Type Safety:** Uses TypeScript for request/response typing.
- **Error Handling:** API helpers provide consistent error handling and response normalization.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Encapsulate all API calls in helper functions.
- Use strong typing for all requests and responses.
- Provide clear error messages and fallback logic.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure API endpoints are correct and backend is running.
- Check for network or CORS errors.

## Extensibility
- Add new API helpers as backend features expand.
- Refactor for DRYness and maintainability.

# Feature Deep Dive: ClientConnect

## Functional Overview
ClientConnect enables secure collaboration and communication with external clients and stakeholders. It provides a dedicated workspace for client-facing projects, file sharing, and messaging.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Pages & Components:** `src/pages/ClientConnect.tsx` provides the main UI for client collaboration, messaging, and file sharing.
- **Service:** Integrates with core collaboration, file, and notification services for seamless client experience.
- **State Management:** Uses React state/hooks for local UI, with context for client workspace state.
- **Integration:** Ties into authentication, file storage, and notification systems for secure, real-time updates.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Isolate client workspaces from internal team areas for security.
- Use service layer for all client-facing operations.
- Provide clear feedback for client actions and permissions.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure correct permissions and workspace isolation for clients.
- Check for sync issues in messaging or file sharing.

## Extensibility
- Add video conferencing, client approval workflows, or external integrations.

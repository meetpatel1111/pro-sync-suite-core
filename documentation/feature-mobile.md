# Feature Deep Dive: Mobile & Responsive Design

## Functional Overview
Mobile and responsive design ensures the application is usable and visually appealing on all devices. Features adapt to screen size, orientation, and input method.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Hooks:** `src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx` detects mobile devices and triggers responsive UI changes.
- **Components:** Responsive layouts, navigation, and input controls.

- **Integration:** All major features/components respond to mobile state for usability.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices

- Provide touch-friendly controls and navigation.
- Test on multiple devices and screen sizes.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all features are accessible and usable on mobile.
- Check for layout or overflow issues on small screens.

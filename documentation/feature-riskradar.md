# Feature Deep Dive: RiskRadar

## Functional Overview
RiskRadar provides risk analysis, alerts, and reporting for projects and resources. It helps teams identify, track, and mitigate risks proactively.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Pages & Components:** `src/pages/RiskRadar.tsx` renders the risk dashboard, alerts, and risk management tools.
- **Service:** `src/services/riskRadarService.ts` and `riskradar.ts` encapsulate all risk-related logic and data access.
- **State Management:** Uses React state/hooks for UI, with service for persistent risk data.
- **Integration:** Works with project, resource, and notification modules for full risk visibility.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Keep risk logic in services; UI should reflect risk state and actions.
- Provide clear visualizations for risk status and trends.
- Allow for custom risk categories and thresholds.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure risk data is loaded before rendering UI.
- Check for missing or outdated risk definitions in the backend.

## Extensibility
- Add automated risk detection, external risk feeds, or advanced analytics.
- Integrate with incident management or compliance tools.

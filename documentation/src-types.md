# Types Documentation (`src/types`)

This document describes the type definitions and type augmentation modules found in the `src/types` folder. Type definitions are essential for ensuring type safety, clarity, and reliability in a TypeScript codebase.

---

## Folder Purpose
- Contains custom type definitions, module augmentations, and type extensions for the application.
- Ensures compatibility with external libraries and frameworks (e.g., Express, Supabase).
- Promotes type safety and reduces runtime errors.

---

## Subfolder: express/

### index.d.ts
- Provides TypeScript type definitions and/or module augmentation for the Express framework.
- Ensures that Express middleware, request handlers, and other integrations are strongly typed.
- May extend or override default Express types for custom middleware, request objects, or response handling.

---

## Best Practices
- Maintain type definitions in a dedicated folder for clarity and maintainability.
- Use module augmentation to extend third-party types when needed.
- Keep type definitions up to date as the codebase evolves.

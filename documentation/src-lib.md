# Library Utilities Documentation (`src/lib`)

This document describes the utility modules found in the `src/lib` folder. Library utilities are used to encapsulate helper functions and shared logic that do not fit into a specific feature, service, or context.

---

## Folder Purpose
- Provides generic, reusable helper functions for use throughout the application.
- Keeps utility logic separate from business and UI code for maintainability.
- Promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and code reuse.

---

## File Summary

### utils.ts
- Contains general-purpose utility functions used in various parts of the app.
- May include helpers for formatting, validation, data transformation, or other common tasks.
- Keeps logic modular and easy to test.

---

## Best Practices
- Place only generic, non-feature-specific helpers in the `lib` folder.
- Write utilities to be pure and side-effect free when possible.
- Document and test utility functions for reliability.

---

For feature-specific helpers, see the `utils` folder or relevant service/component files.

# Feature Deep Dive: Sidebar & Navigation

## Functional Overview
The Sidebar provides global navigation, quick access to all major features, and context-aware shortcuts. It ensures users can efficiently move between workspaces, tools, and settings.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Components:** Sidebar, navigation links, icons, context-aware badges (notifications, unread, etc.).
- **State Management:** Uses React state/hooks for active route, collapsed/expanded state, and badge counts.
- **Integration:** Ties into context providers for notifications, unread counts, and workspace switching.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Keep navigation logic separate from feature logic.
- Use icons and badges for quick status visibility.
- Support keyboard navigation and accessibility.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure active route highlighting works as expected.
- Check for missing or incorrect badge counts.

## Extensibility
- Add customizable shortcuts, theming, or advanced navigation features.
- Integrate with mobile/responsive navigation.

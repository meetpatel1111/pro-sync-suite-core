# Feature Deep Dive: Utility Layer

## Functional Overview
The utility layer provides helper functions, type definitions, and sample data to support services, contexts, and components. It promotes code reuse, type safety, and maintainability.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **db-helpers.ts:** Helper functions for database operations, query building, and data transformation.
- **dbtypes.d.ts / dbtypes.ts:** TypeScript type definitions for database entities, ensuring type safety across the app.
- **sampleData.ts:** Provides mock/sample data for development and testing.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Keep utility logic generic and reusable.
- Use type definitions to enforce consistency.
- Isolate sample/mock data from production logic.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure utility functions are imported where needed.
- Check for outdated or missing type definitions.

## Extensibility
- Add new helpers as common patterns emerge.
- Extend type definitions as the data model evolves.

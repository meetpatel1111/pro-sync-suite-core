# Feature Deep Dive: BudgetBuddy

## Functional Overview
BudgetBuddy enables budgeting and financial planning for projects and organizations. Users can create budgets, track expenses, and generate reports.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Pages & Components:** `src/pages/BudgetBuddy.tsx` provides the UI for budget creation, editing, and visualization.
- **Service:** `src/services/budgetBuddyService.ts` and `budgetbuddy.ts` handle all budgeting logic and data access.
- **State Management:** Uses React state/hooks for local UI, with service for persistent data.
- **Integration:** Connects with project, resource, and reporting modules for full financial visibility.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Keep budgeting logic in services; UI should only display and interact.
- Provide visual feedback for budget status and changes.
- Support exporting and reporting for stakeholders.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure budget data is loaded before rendering.
- Check for calculation or sync errors in reports.

## Extensibility
- Add forecasting, multi-currency, or integration with accounting tools.
- Extend reporting and analytics features.

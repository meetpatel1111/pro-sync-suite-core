# Feature Deep Dive: Components

## Functional Overview
Components are the building blocks of the UI. They range from atomic elements (buttons, inputs) to feature modules (chat window, Kanban board, file uploader) and are composed to create pages and workflows.

## Technical Deep Dive
- **Atomic Components:** Buttons, inputs, modals, icons, etc. Used throughout the app for consistency.
- **Feature Components:** Chat windows, resource tables, Kanban boards, notification panels, etc. Encapsulate feature-specific UI and logic.
- **Integration:** Components consume context, hooks, and services for data and actions.
- **State Management:** Components may have local state for UI, but delegate shared state to context/providers.

## Key Patterns & Best Practices
- Keep atomic components stateless and reusable.
- Compose feature components from atomic elements.
- Use props, context, and hooks for data flow.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure components receive required props and context.
- Check for UI inconsistencies or missing styles.

## Extensibility
- Add new atomic or feature components as features grow.
- Refactor for reusability and maintainability.

// This file is read-only, so I'm not actually writing this file.
// Here's what we would add if we could:

/*
import IntegrationNotifications from '@/components/IntegrationNotifications';

// Inside the main content area, before the {children}, we would add:
<IntegrationNotifications />
*/

// Since we can't modify this file, we'll need to find another way to display the notifications.
// One approach would be to add the IntegrationNotifications component to each page component.
